pikachu python project

Key Points for Effective Comments:
Explain the purpose of functions: Clearly describe what each function does.
Document complex logic: If your code involves intricate calculations or conditions, add comments to explain the reasoning.
Use docstrings: For more detailed explanations, use docstrings (triple quotes) at the beginning of functions.
Be concise: Avoid overly long comments.
Stay updated: Keep comments in sync with code changes.
Additional Tips:
Break down complex shapes: If drawing Pikachu's parts is challenging, create smaller functions for specific elements (e.g., draw_eye(), draw_mouth()).
Use variables: Store color values, coordinates, or other constants in variables for better readability.
Leverage modules: Consider using modules to organize your code if the project grows larger.
